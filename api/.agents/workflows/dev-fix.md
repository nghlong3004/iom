# 🛠 Dev-Fix — Professional Bug Remediation

This workflow manages the bug-fix lifecycle from issue analysis to PR/MR delivery. It enforces a strict **Propose -> Approve -> Verify** cycle using native artifacts.

## Input

`/dev-fix <issue-url-or-key>`

## Workflow

### Step 0: Environment Prep (Turbo)

// turbo
1. **Sync Registry**: `git pull origin main` in the standard repo.

### Step 1: Research & Discovery (Implementation Plan Phase)

> [!TIP]
> **Sub-Agent Delegation**: If your platform supports sub-agents, delegate ticket extraction to the matching issue specialist and context lookup to `@specialist-confluence-searcher` or `@specialist-codebase-scout`. If sub-agents are NOT supported, execute these steps yourself.

1.  **Analyze Ticket**: Use installed Jira/GitHub/GitLab/ADO MCP first; otherwise use exported ticket text. Extract `Reproduce steps`, `Expected Result`, and `Actual Result`.
2.  **Cross-Check Context**: Use Confluence/docs MCP when configured; otherwise use exported docs and local code search. Locate relevant code.
3.  **Create Implementation Plan**: 
    - Use the **Implementation Plan Template** below.
    - Initialize project-local `docs/specs/implementation-plan-[slug].md`.
    - **Goal**: Clear description of the root cause.
    - **Proposed Changes**: Exact files and logic to be modified.
    - **Verification Plan**: Detail which QE skill (`playwright-cli` or `appium-mcp`) will be used to verify the fix *locally* before PR.
4.  **HARD STOP**: Request user approval for the implementation plan.
5.  **Readiness Gate**: Run `implementation-readiness`; code only after READY or approved PARTIAL.

### Step 2: Implementation (TDD Phase)

> [!TIP]
> **Sub-Agent Delegation**: For the actual fix, delegate the TDD loop to your TDD Implementer sub-agent (`@specialist-tdd-implementer`). If sub-agents are NOT supported, execute the TDD loop yourself using `common-tdd`.

1.  **Worktree Branching**: Create a new worktree for the fix using `git worktree add ../<ticket-key> -b fix/<ticket-key>` and `cd` into it.
2.  **Task Tracking**: 
    - Use the **Task Template** below.
    - Initialize project-local `docs/templates/task.md`.
3.  **Code**: Implement the fix using `common-tdd` or the `@specialist-tdd-implementer` sub-agent. Follow `common-best-practices` and service-specific `AGENTS.md` rules.

### Step 3: Local Verification (Enterprise Standard)

Do NOT rely on "it builds" — verify the fix against the issue reproduction steps.

1.  **Launch Dev Server**: Run the local dev environment for the service.
2.  **Execute QE Audit**:
    - **Web**: Load `quality-engineering-playwright-cli`. Run the reproduction steps. Capture "After" snapshots.
    - **Mobile**: Load `quality-engineering-appium-mcp`. Run the reproduction steps on an emulator.
3.  **Final Verdict**: Compare results against the issue `Expected Result`. If any sub-3px regressions exist, fix them now.

### Step 4: Deliver PR

1.  **Commit**: Generate a commit message using `caveman-commit`.
2.  **PR/MR Details**: Draft provider-appropriate PR/MR notes and link the source issue.
3.  **Walkthrough**: 
    - Use the **Walkthrough Template** below.
    - Create project-local `docs/templates/walkthrough.md` with evidence of the local verification.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

- **No Blind Implementation**: Never write code before the implementation plan is approved.
- **No Orphan Sessions**: Always `close` browser/appium sessions used during verification.
- **No skipping local verify**: "I checked it manually" is not enough. Provide snapshots/logs in the project-local `docs/templates/walkthrough.md`.
