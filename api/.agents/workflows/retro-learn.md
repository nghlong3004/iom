# Retro Learn Workflow

Goal: Turn defects, missed expectations, and delivery friction into durable standards improvements.

## Steps

1. Gather evidence:
   - Review findings
   - Bugs found during verification
   - Security findings
   - User corrections
   - Failed or slow checks
   - Token or context pain
   - `session-report` artifacts
2. Classify:
   - Skill rule gap
   - Eval coverage gap
   - Workflow gap
   - Documentation gap
   - Tooling gap
   - Specialist gap
   - Environment-only issue
3. Decide action:
   - Existing skill should prevent it: update `SKILL.md` and `evals/evals.json`.
   - No skill covers it: propose a new skill.
   - Workflow caused drift: update `.agents/workflows`.
   - Tooling can catch it: add or update an audit script.
4. Verify learning:
   - Run changed skill validation.
   - Run alignment checks.
   - Record remaining follow-ups.
